# Getting started

Our documentation on this is quite thin at the moment.
If you want to see how this actually works,
the best place to look right now is in `tests/test-data/example-project`
(relative to the project's root)
because this contains a complete, self-contained project setup.

There is some information in [notebooks](notebooks-reference),
but we are working on filling that out too.
If there is a documentation topic of interest to you,
please [raise an issue](https://github.com/climate-resource/pydoit-nb/issues).

We hope to provide a more complete introduction soon.
